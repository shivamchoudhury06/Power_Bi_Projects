# LinkedIn Dashboard

In this Dashboard I have downloaded the data from LinkedIn and used that data to make a dashboard in powerbi.

In this dashboard I have displayed the following data:

* Total number of connections
* Total number of unique connections
* Total number of outgoing and incoming messages
* Month-wise connections
* Total connections by company
* Count of conncection source
